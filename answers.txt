What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

virus_name = 'Small Pox'
repro_rate = 5.8
mortality_rate = 0.15
population_size = 10000
vacc_percentage = 20
initial_infected = 4

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

Infections: 7996 

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

Number of deaths: 1025

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

Number of interactions vaccines prevented infection: 355754
