# Herd Immunity Simulation

This is a simulation of herd immunity that models how a virus moves through a population taking into consideration those that are vaccinated against the virus.

## How the simulator works:

To run the simulator: 

  python3 simulation.py

## Logger

After the simulator has been run, a logger file will be produced that includes the metadata about the virus and population, information about each time step that was run before herd immunity was achieved, and the final statistics from the simulation.
